Hi, I'm Geneva Jacobs, when I'm not in school, I like to immerse myself in the field of everything tech. Here is some of what I've been up to:
### 2024: 
I was invited to volunteer at the Meaningful XR conference in San Francisco to learn about topics in XR.

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
