In this project, I prototyped a recipe searching app in Adobe XD, aimed at students who want to cook with certain ingredients. 
#### The Process:
1. "Blue sky" brainstorming
2. Decide on a recipe app aimed at MSU students.
3. Competitive analysis
4. Low fidelity paper prototype
5. User Persona
6. Video Prototype
7. High-fidelity prototype in Adobe XD
