#### About the course:
MI 488 was a limited course sponsored by the Mozilla Foundation for Responsible Computing. Throughout the course, we collaborated with students and professors from Egerton University, applying Human Centered Design to address farming challenges in Kenya. 



#### What I did:
I followed the human centered design process to prototype an app that alows farmers to access market and crop-growing information, and buy and sell produce online.
